# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Purpose of Crowdfunding_ETL
- The purpose of the Crowdfunding_ETL challenge was to collaborate as a team in order to build an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline using Python and Pandas as well as other dictionaries to extract and transform data. From there we were also tasked with creating comma-seperated value (CSV) files with the transformed data. With the CSV files created we also needed to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema which would display the relationship between the data in a Postgres SQL (structured query language) database that we were also tasked with creating. 

## Resources/Technologies used 
- In order to accomplish our task of building this ETL Pipeline we were provided a Jupyter Notebook with a basic outline of what the deliverables were and also contained a small amount of starter code as well as two excel files with our values that we needed to use to accomplish our tasks. Within the Jupyter Notebook file we found it necessary to import the following libraries in order to accomplish our tasks.
  - Pandas: an open source software library for Data Analysis in Python.
  - Numpy: an open source python library used for large, multidimensional arrays and advanced mathematics.
  - Datetime: a module that allows us to manipulate times into easier to read formats.
  - Json: A module that allows us to work with JavaScript Object Notation to change data formats.
  - Sqlalchemy: an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relation mapper.
  - Seaborn: a visualization library for matplotlib.
  - Matplotlib: A library for python visualizations.
  - PostgreSQL: An open source relational database management system that works with SQL.
 

## Navigating this Repository
- The Repository consists of a main branch which holds two Jupyter Notebook files and A Readme markdown file as well as licensing info and a folder entitled Resources.
  - Resources: holds our images as wells as our CSVs and SQL files.
    - Contains four CSV files entitled: "campaign.csv", "category.csv", "contacts.csv", and "subcategory.csv".
    - Four PNG files that display our queries and our diagram.
    - A pdf version of our ERD.
    - 3 SQL files which contain our queries and Schema for our database.
